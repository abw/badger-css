# Spacing

The `mar` and `pad` CSS utility classes can be used to set the margins and
padding for an element.

## Margins

The `mar` class by itself will add 1 unit of margin to all four sides of an
element.  The default unit size is `0.25rem`.

<Example
  html={Margin}
  caption="Margins"
  expand
/>

The `mar-N` classes will add multiples of the unit, where `N` is one of the
values: `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `6`, `8`, `10`, `12`, `16`, `20`, `24`, `28`
or `32`.  The `mar-1` class is effectively the same as just `mar` but is
included for completeness.  Also note that `mar-0` can be used to remove any
margin that would otherwise be present on an element.

<Example
  html={MarginN}
  caption="Margin Multiple"
  expand
/>

## Margin Directions

You can also specify the direction for the margin using the `mar-t` (top),
`mar-r` (right), `mar-b` (bottom), `mar-l` (left), `mar-v` (vertical: top and
bottom) and `mar-h` (horizontal: left and right) classes. The default is 1
unit of margin or a `-N` suffix can be added as a multiplier.  For example
`mar-t-4` to add 4 units of margin to the top of an element.

<Example
  html={MarginDir}
  caption="Margin Direction"
  expand
/>

## Padding

The `pad` and related utility classes work in the same way but add padding
inside the element.

<Example
  html={Padding}
  caption="Padding"
  expand
/>

One important thing to note is that padding is applied in multiples of
0.25**em** whereas margins use 0.25**rem**.  This is because you usually want
spacing around elements to be consistent (which rem provides) but padding
inside an element should be based on the text size (which em provides).

<Example
  html={PadSize}
  caption="Pad Sizes"
  expand
/>

## Adaptive Padding

The `pad-a-N` utility classes apply adaptive padding.  In the horizontal
direction N units of padding will be added.  In the vertical direction N-1
units will be added.

Consider the example below.  The buttons in the left column have equal padding
in both directions, whereas those in the right column have adaptive padding.
Counterintuitively, the padding in the right buttons looks more balanced,
particularly at low values.  This is because the line height of the text is
typically around 1.5 (or slightly less) resulting in around 0.25em of implicit
vertical padding in the text before the additional padding is added.  By
adding one unit less of padding in the vertical direction the adaptive padding
classes cancel out this imbalance.

<Example
  html={Adaptive}
  caption="Adaptive Padding"
  expand
/>
