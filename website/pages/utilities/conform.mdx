# Conform

The <code>conform</code> class creates a fluid container that
stretches to the full width of the parent element with some padding
on each side.

By itself it's not particularly interesting.  There's really
not much difference between this and defining an element with horizontal
padding, e.g. using <code>pad-h-8</code>...

<div className="conform surface-2 border flow pad-v-6">
  ### `conform`

  We're very lucky in the sense that we've got two visionaries
  in the band.  David and Nigel are both like, uh, like poets, you know,
  like Shelley or Byron, or people like that. The two totally distinct
  types of visionaries.  It's like fire and ice, basically, you see,
  and I feel my role in the band, is to be kind of in the middle of that,
  kind of like lukewarm water, in a sense.

## Breakpoint Widths

<div className="conform-mobile surface-2 border pad-v-6">
  ### `conform-mobile`

  ...but it gets more interesting when you add a breakpoint suffix to set the
  conform width, e.g. `conform-mobile`.  Now the conform will be centered and
  contained to the breakpoint size.

  Now you may be wondering how this is any different to using the `mobile`
  class to set the width and `block-center` to center it?  Well it all comes
  down to being able to break out of the box.

  {<section className="popout blue bgc-30 fgc-90 pad-v-6">
    <h3 className="fgc-100 font-mono">popout</h3>
    This is a popout section.  It's pushed out a bit wider than the
    normal conform.
  </section>}

  He did a twist on it. A twist and it... He did, he did. He turned it
  around. We shoulda thought of that. We were so close. I mean if we
  had all you guys tied up, that probably woulda been fine.

  {<section className="feature indigo bgc-30 fgc-90 pad-v-6">
    <h3 className="fgc-100 font-mono">feature</h3>
    This is a feature section.  It's pushed out even further than the
    normal conform.  How much more wider could this be? And the answer
    is...
  </section>}

  But it's, it's still a stupid cover. It's such a fine
  line between stupid and... and clever. Yeah, and clever. Just that
  little turnabout...

  {<section className="full-width violet bgc-30 fgc-90 pad-h-8 pad-v-6">
    <h3 className="fgc-100 font-mono">full-width</h3>
    <p>
      ...a lot wider!  This is a full-width section.  You see, most... most
      blokes, you know, will be playing at ten. You're on ten here... all the
      way up... all the way up... all the way up. You're on ten on your
      guitar... where can you go from there? Where? Nowhere. Exactly. What we
      do is if we need that extra... push over the cliff... you know what we do?
      Put it up to eleven. Eleven. Exactly. One louder.
    </p>
  </section>}

  I do not, for one, think that the problem was that the band was down.
  I think that the problem may have been...that there was a Stonehenge
  monument on the stage that was in danger of being crushed by a dwarf.
  Alright? That tended to understate the hugeness of the object.

  {<section className="full-width conform-mobile purple bgc-30 fgc-90 pad-v-6">
    <h3 className="fgc-100 font-mono">conform-mobile</h3>
    <p>
      You can add a conform class to a full-width section and it will contain
      the conform.  So you get a full width background, but contained conform.
    </p>
  </section>}

  And I don't think that a sexy cover is the answer for why an album sells or
  doesn't sell because you tell me, the "White Album", what was that? There
  was nothing on that goddamn cover.
