# Split

## Evenly Split Columns

The `split-N` classes can be used to set the width of an element to a fraction
of the width of the parent container. For example, `split-2` sets the width to
one half, `split-3` to one third, and so on.  The value for `N` can be
anything from 2 to 16.

They can be useful in conjunction with the <FlexLink/> classes to constrain
columns to be a particular width.  Otherwise the flexbox layout engine will
try to expand the width of columns that have more content.

<Example
  html={Even}
  caption="Even Splits"
/>

## Unevenly Split Columns

The `split-N-M` classes can be used to create uneven splits. For example,
`split-2-5` creates a columns that is two fifths of the width.

These are defined for all uneven splits up to tenths (e.g. there's a
`split-3-10` class for three tenths, but no `split-3-11` for three elevenths).
Note that redundant classes are not included. For example, there's no
`split-3-6` class because it's the same thing as one half or `split-2`.

<Example
  html={Uneven}
  caption="Uneven Splits"
/>

## Tables

The `split-*` classes also work with table columns. This can be useful to
prevent the layout engine from expanding columns to fit the content.  It's
especially useful if you have multiple tables and you want the columns to be
the same width in each of the tables.

<Example
  html={Table}
  caption="Table Splits"
/>

## Split Classes

  You can set the `$splits` SASS variable if you want to
  define a different set of splits.
