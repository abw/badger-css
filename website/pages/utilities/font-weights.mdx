# Font Weights

## Weight Names

The `weight-<name>` classes can be used to set the font weight.

The values for `<name>` can be `thin`, `extra-light`, `light`, `regular`,
`medium`, `semi-bold`, `bold`, `extra-bold` or `black`.

## Weight Numbers

Alternately you can use the corresponding weight numbers.

Those numbers can be `100`, `200`, `300`, `400`, `500`, `600`, `700`, `800`
or `900`.

## Weight Aliases

There are some short-cut aliases for the common cases.  Note that we
use `thick` rather than `black` to avoid any confusion with the color black.

  You can set the `$font-weights` SASS variable if you want to define a
  different set of font weights.
