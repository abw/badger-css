# Shadows

## Shadow Classes

Use the `shadow-1`, `shadow-2`, `shadow-3`, `shadow-4` and `shadow-5` CSS
classes to add a box shadow of progressively larger size.  Larger shadows can
be used to suggest that an element is lifted higher off the background and
thus appears closer to the foreground.

## Shadow Properties

The shadow styles are defined as CSS custom properties, (e.g. `--shadow-1`,
`--shadow-2`, etc).  The colors and opacities used for the shadows depend on
both the shadow depth and color theme.  For the default light theme the base
color is `--grey-0` and the shadows are more transparent.  For the dark theme,
where shadows need to be a bit more prominent to be visible, the base color is
`black` and the shadows are more opaque.

The benefit of CSS custom properties is that you can easily apply them to your
own style rules.  In this example we define a `.shadow-example` rule which
adds a `box-shadow` using the `--shadow-2` custom property.  The shadow color
will be set correctly for both light and dark themes so you don't need to
worry about defining separate rules for each.
