# Surfaces

When building UI components it can be useful to think in terms of "surfaces",
with each surface getting progressively "closer" to the user and demanding
their closer attention. You may want to combine these with the `shadow-N`
classes to further emphasise the effect.

As a general rule surfaces that are in the foreground should be lighter than
those in the background.  Note that this applies to dark themes as well as light themes.

## Surface Classes

Use the `surface-1`, `surface-2`, `surface-3`, `surface-4` and `surface-5` CSS
classes to define elements with appropriate background and text colors to
achieve this effect.  The lower numbers are meant to be further in the
background with higher numbers being closer to the foreground.

<Example
  html={Surfaces}
  caption="Surfaces"
  expand
/>

The `surface` class is a special case being used here to apply a background
color for the examples.  When using a light theme this is `white` and for a
dark theme it is `black`. This also has the `paper` alias (which I find easier
to remember).

<Example
  html={Paper}
  caption="surface / paper"
  expand
/>

The styles are defined using CSS variables for the foreground, background and
border colors, e.g. `--color`, `--background-color` and `--border-color`. In
turn these are defined using the `grey` color range depending on the color
theme. For example, the `--background-color` for `--surface-3`is defined to
be `--color-90` by default, and `--color-10` when the dark theme is in effect.

## Surfaces With Borders

Add the `border` CSS class to add a border around a surface. You can also add
the <BorderLink className="code" text="bdr-N"/> classes to set the border
radius.

<Example
  html={SurfacesBorder}
  caption="Surface Borders"
  expand
/>

## Colored Surfaces

Add any of the color classes to get different colored surfaces.

<Example
  html={SurfacesColor}
  caption="Color Surfaces"
/>
