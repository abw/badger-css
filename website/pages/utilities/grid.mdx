# Grid

## Grid Columns

Use a `grid-N` CSS class to set the `display` mode to `grid` where `N` is the
number of columns from 2 to 16.

<Snippet
  file="grid/grid.html"
  caption="Grid Columns"
  expand output
/>

## Gaps

The `gap-N` classes can be used to add a gap between successive elements.
Here `N` is a number from 1 to 16 representing multiples of the default
spacing unit (`0.25rem` by default).

<Snippet
  file="grid/gap.html"
  caption="Grid Gaps"
  expand output
/>

## Vertical and Horizontal Gaps

The the `gap-v-N` and `gap-h-N` classes can be used to define the vertical and
horizontal gaps separately. Again, `N` is a number from 1 to 16 representing
multiples of the default spacing unit.

<Snippet
  file="grid/gap-vh.html"
  caption="Grid Gaps"
  expand output
/>

## Single Column Grid

The `grid` CSS class (or `grid-1` which does the same thing) creates a single
column grid.  It's useful because it then allows you to use the `gap-N`
classes to add a vertical gap between child components.

<Snippet
  file="grid/grid-1.html"
  caption="Single Column Grid"
  expand output
/>

## Grid Fit

The `grid-fit` CSS class will fit as many items into the grid as it can and
then wrap onto the next line.

<Snippet
  file="grid/fit.html"
  caption="Grid Fit"
  expand output
/>

## Grid Fill

The `grid-fill` CSS class is similar to `grid-fit`. The difference between
them is what happens when there are't enough items to fill the container
width.  `grid-fit` will stretch them whereas `grid-fill` will not.

<Snippet
  file="grid/fill.html"
  caption="Grid Fill"
  expand output
/>

## Grid Fit / Fill Size

Both `grid-fit` and `grid-fill` can define a minimum size for each child
element.  By default this is `100px` wide.  You can set the `--min-width`
property to change it.

<Snippet
  file="grid/fit-200.html"
  caption="Grid Size"
  expand output
/>

## Column / Row Spans

Add the `cols-N` to a child of a grid to have it span `N` columns (from 2 to
16).  Add the `rows-N` to have it span `N` rows.

<Snippet
  file="grid/span.html"
  caption="Grid Spanning"
  expand output
/>

## Grid Top

Add the `top` (or `start`) CSS class to align items to the top of grid columns.

<Snippet
  file="grid/top.html"
  caption="Grid Top"
  expand output
/>

## Grid Middle

Add the `middle` CSS class to align items to the middle of grid columns.

<Snippet
  file="grid/middle.html"
  caption="Grid Middle"
  expand output
/>

## Grid Bottom

Add the `bottom` (or `end`) CSS class to align items to the end of grid columns.

<Snippet
  file="grid/bottom.html"
  caption="Grid Bottom"
  expand output
/>

## Grid Overlap

Add the `overlap` CSS class to stack all children of the grid on top of each
other.  This can be used when you want to layer some content on top of a
background, for example.

<Snippet
  file="grid/overlap-text.html"
  caption="Grid Overlap"
  expand output
/>

You can also use it to hide previous components.  In this example, we create a
label with a checkbox input (which is functional) but hide it with overlaid
content.

<Snippet
  file="grid/overlap.html"
  caption="Grid Overlap"
  expand output
/>
