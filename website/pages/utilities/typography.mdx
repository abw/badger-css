# Typography

## Headings

Headings have `text-wrap: balance` set to balance the length of long lines.
The `line-height` is reduced to `1.3`.

Margins and padding are removed by default.  You can add them in yourself,
either using the <SpacingLink/> utiltiy classes or globally to match your site
style. Or use something like the `flow` class (see below) to add margins
between elements where appropriate.

<Example
  html={Headings}
  caption="Headings"
/>

## Flow

Use the `flow` class on a container to add spacing between block elements.
