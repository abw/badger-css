# Utility Classes

<div className="intro">
  CSS utility classes are *extremely* useful for applying styles to
  elements on an ad-hoc basis.  But they shouldn't be used as a substitute
  for writing CSS for reusable styles.

    ## Moderation in All Things

    Some CSS frameworks, most notably <TailwindLink/>, have taken this to the
    extreme where everything is a utility class and you never need to write
    any CSS at all. Although this approach has some merits for rapid
    prototyping, I personally wouldn't use it when building a non-trivial site
    because I think that it can have a negative impact on readability and
    maintainability.

    I prefer to take the pragmatic approach and use utility classes to apply
    *exceptional* styling to elements that don't warrant having their own
    dedicated CSS classes.  The general rule that I follow is to create
    dedicated CSS classes for components that I'm using in different places
    in a site.  For example, a product card, a user avatar, button and form
    styling, and so.  This ensures that they are consistent and can easily be
    changed across the whole site by updating the rules in the stylesheet.

    For styling that depends on the context in which an element is being used,
    I'll generally reach for utility classes. By far the most useful of these,
    and the ones that I use more than any other, are the `mar` and `pad`
    utility classes to add custom margins and padding. The amount of margin or
    padding required on an element will often depend on the other elements
    around it, so there isn't a "one size fits all" solution. Other useful
    utility classes include those to set the font size, add a border or drop
    shadow, or to set the layout to use flexbox or grid.

    ## CSS Custom Properties

    CSS custom properties or CSS variables as they are also know, are an
    incredibly powerful addition to the toolkit for any web designer or
    developer.  They allow you to define reusable "snippets" of CSS that can
    easily be applied to different elements.  They can be used to replace much
    of the functionality that was previously only accessible by using
    variables and/or mixins in a CSS pre-processing language like <SassLink/>.

    ## SASS Variables

    Although CSS custom properties have largely removed the need for CSS
    pre-processors like SASS, there are still benefits to be had from using
    them.  One benefit is that they can help to reduce bloat in your CSS
    files.  SASS allows you to define variables that can be used to implement
    system-wide configuration options that are then compiled into the
    generated CSS files.  In contrast, any CSS custom properties that you use
    must be included in the CSS and, if overdone, can lead to significant
    increases in the file size.

    ## When to Use Each?

    The general rule that I follow is to use SASS variables for configuration
    options that I might want to change on a site-wide basis but generally
    remain constant throughout the site.  For example, the default font face,
    the breakpoints, the colors or default spacing units.  It's useful to have
    these defined as variables because it allows me to plug Badger CSS into a
    project, tweak the default settings, and then get coding.  If at some
    point in the future I decide they're not quite right, or if the client or
    a designer wants me to change them, then it should be easy to do so, and
    they should be applied universally.

    For styles that I might want to change in different parts of the site,
    need to reflect some application state (e.g. the differences between
    a success, warning or error message), or that should have different
    properties depending on the user selecting a light or dark theme, then
    CSS properties are generally the way to go.

    For styles that need to be applied on an ad-hoc basis, utility classes
    are what I reach for.
