# Scolling

## Scroll Classes

Add the `scroll-x` or `scroll-y` CSS classes to set `overflow-x` or
`overflow-y` to `scroll`, respectively.

Be warned that you'll also need to set widths and/or heights as appropriate to
stop the layout engine from doing the "right" thing and expanding the
containers to fit the content.

<Snippet
  file="scrolling/scroll-x.html"
  caption="scroll-x"

<Snippet
  file="scrolling/scroll-y.html"
  caption="scroll-y"
  expand output
/>

## Overflow Hack

One problem with explicit scrolling classes is that it can prevent overflow
from being visible.  When `overflow-x` is set to `scroll`, `overflow-y` is
implicitly set to `auto` which equates to the same thing as `hidden`. To the
best of my knowledge there's no way to override this built-in behaviour
(please correct me if I'm wrong).  The problem here is that any overflowing
content in a scrolling container will be hidden.

For example, try hovering over the words in the text below to trigger some
tooltips.  You'll see that the tooltips are hidden because it can't overflow
outside the container.

<Snippet
  file="scrolling/overflow-hidden.html"
  caption="Overflow Hidden"
  expand output
/>

There's a partial work-around this this, which is at best a dirty, dirty hack.
Add the `overflow-hack` class to your container and it will add `100vh` of
padding to the bottom, and `-100vh` of margin.  That will at least allow
content to overflow the bottom of the container.  It's not possible to safely
add padding and margins to all four sides because the element will then
overlay and interfere with other elements.
