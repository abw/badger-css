# Wrap

The `wrap` CSS class sets the `text-wrap` to `wrap` (which is the default).
The `nowrap` class unsurprisingly sets it to `nowrap`.  The `wrap-balance`,
`wrap-pretty` and `wrap-stable` classes set it to `balance`, `pretty` and
`stable` respectively.

You may not see much difference between them.  Try resizing your browser
window to see how they flow differently.
