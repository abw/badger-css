# Alignment

## Text Alignment

Add the `text-left`, `text-center` and `text-right` CSS classes to set the
text alignment.

<Snippet
  file="alignment/text.html"
  caption="Text Alignment"
  expand output
/>

Text is aligned left by default making the `text-left` class *mostly*
redundant.  However it can be useful to reset the alignment to the left for
a block that would otherwise be aligned centrally or to the right

<Snippet
  file="alignment/text-left.html"
  caption="Text Left"
  expand output
/>

## Block Alignment

Add the `block-left`, `block-center` and `block-right` CSS classes to align a
block to the left, in the center, or on the right, respectively.

You'll need to set a block width to stop it from expanding to fill the full
width of the parent element.  You can do that using one of the <WidthLink/>
utility classes.

<Snippet
  file="alignment/block.html"
  caption="Block Alignment"
  expand output
