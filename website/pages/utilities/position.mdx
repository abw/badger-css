# Position

## Position Classes

Add the `absolute`, `relative` and `fixed` CSS classes to set the position
type.

For elements that are set to `absolute` or `fixed` position, the `top`,
`bottom`, `left` and `right` classes can be used to position them against the
corresponding edge of the closest parent element with the `relative` position
type.
