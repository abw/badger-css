# Alerts

The `alert` class can be used to display alerts. Add any of the `info`,
`success`, `warning` or `error` classes to set the color.

## Demo

Select the options to determine how the alert is displayed. Note that some
options are mutually exclusive (e.g. stripe and border).

<Demo/>

## Default Alerts

<Snippet
  file="alert/alert.html"
  caption="Alerts"
  output
/>

## Alerts With Borders

Add the `border` class to add a border.

<Snippet
  file="alert/border.html"
  caption="Added Borders"
  output
/>

## Alert Headings

Headings are displayed in a slightly darker color than the body text.

<Snippet
  file="alert/heads.html"
  caption="Alert Headings"
  output
/>

## Alert Headlines

Add an element with the `headline` class to really make it stand out.  This
works well with and without borders.  Throw in a <ShadowLink/> if you want to
make it really pop.

<Snippet
  file="alert/headlines.html"
  caption="Alert Headlines"
  output
/>

## Compact Alerts

Add the `compact` class to reduce some of the padding if you need a smaller
alert for a tight space

<Snippet
  file="alert/compact.html"
  caption="Compact Alert"
  output
/>

## Stripe Alerts

For a more subdued look, try adding the `stripe` class.

<Snippet
  file="alert/stripe.html"
  caption="Stripe Alert"
  output
/>
