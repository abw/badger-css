# Dialog

Some default styling is provided for the `dialog` element which can be used
to display modals.

## Close Button

A child element with the `close` CSS class can be used to create a close
button.

<Split>
  <Source
    code={DialogSrc}
    caption="Dialog"
    language="html"
    expand
  />
  <Dialog/>
</Split>

The `$dialog-max-width` SASS variable defaults to `80vw` and is set as the
`--max-width` CSS variable in the scope of a `dialog` element. Similarly the
`$dialog-max-height` SASS variable defaults to `90vh` and is set as the
`--max-height` CSS variable.

In general, you can constrain the width of the content and the dialog which
size appropriately.

<Split>
  <DialogWide/>
  <DialogTall/>
</Split>

## Header and Footer

You can add `header` and `footer` elements to a dialog.  To be semantically
correct, you should enclose them in an `article` element.

<Split>
  <Source
    code={ArticleSrc}
    caption="Header and Footer"
    language="html"
    className="mar-b-8"
    expand
  />
  <DialogArticle/>
</Split>
