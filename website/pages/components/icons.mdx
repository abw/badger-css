# Icons

Some basic styles are included for SVG icons. Add the `icon` class to an
inline SVG image to use them.

<Example
  html={Icon}
  language="html"
  caption="Icon"
/>

## Sizing

Icons are sized in em units meaning they scale with text in different sizes.

<Example
  html={IconSizes}
  language="html"
  caption="Icon Sizes"
/>

## Fill and Stroke Colors

SVG icons can use `currentColor` for either the `fill` or `stroke` properties
to inherit the current text color.

<Example
  html={IconColors}
  language="html"
  caption="Icon Colors"
/>

<Split align="bottom">
  <div>
    SVG elements can use the `fill-fg` and `fill-bg`
    classes to set the fill color to the current foreground or background
    colors respectively.  Similarly the `stroke-fg` and
    `stroke-bg` will set the stroke color to the foreground or
    background color.

    These CSS rules are scoped to all `svg` elements rather
    `svg.icon` specifically.  So you can use them in any
    SVG images, not just icons.
  </div>
  <Note>
    CSS styles can only be applied to inline SVG elements.  They
    don't work for SVG images loaded using the `img`
    tag or applied using a `background-image` style.
  </Note>
</Split>

<Example
  html={IconStyle}
  language="html"
  caption="Icon Style"
/>

You can also use the `flc-N` and `stc-N` classes to set the fill color or
stroke color of an SVG element to a stop in the current palette.  The `fld-N`
and `std-N` classes allow you to set different fill or stroke color stops for
dark mode.

<Example
  html={IconStops}
  language="html"
  caption="Icon Style"
/>

## Custom Styling

You can define your own styles to target different elements in an SVG icon.
This example illustrated the use of generic `--color-N` variables to set the
fill and stroke styles on elements in an icon.  The only thing that's
determining the color range is the `blue` class on the `svg` element.  Change
that to the name of any other color range and the styles will work equally
well.

Also note the use of the `--unfilled` custom property which sets the
background color for the unchecked checkbox.  This allows us to set different
color stops for use in light and dark themes.

<Example
  html={IconCustom}
  language="html"
  caption="Icon Style"
/>

## Animation Effects

<Split align="end">
  <div>
      The `spin` CSS class will make the icon spin.  Ideal for
      spinners!  Add the `reverse` class to reverse the direction.

      The default animation time is 2s.  You can add the `fast` CSS
      class to double the speed (animation time is 1s) or `slow` to
      halve it (animation time is 4s).  Or you can set the
      `--icon-animation-time` property to anything you like.
  </div>
  <Note>
    These animations are disabled if the user's browser has
    the `prefers-reduced-motion` option set to `reduce`.
  </Note>
</Split>

<Example
  html={IconSpin}
  language="html"
  caption="Icon Spin"
/>

The `beat` CSS class will make the icon beat.

The default animation time here is 1s.  The `fast` class doubles the speed
(animation time is 0.5s) and the `slow` class halves it (animation speed is 2s).

<Example
  html={IconBeat}
  language="html"
  caption="Icon Beat"
/>
