# Customising With Sass

  This is what the main `badger.scss` file looks like.

## Custom `badger.scss`

<Snippet
  file="sass/badger.scss"
  caption="Custom badger.scss"
  expand

  You can create your own version of this file if you want to pick and choose
  which parts you want and don't want. You just need to prefix each file path
  with `@abw/badger-css/styles`.

  For example, instead of `@import "helpers/all.scss";` you would write
  `@import "@abw/badger-css/styles/helpers/all.scss";`.
</Snippet>

## Other Files

Each of the `all.scss` file is an index which loads the other files in that
directory.  The first two, `helpers/all.scss` and `config/all.scss` are
mandatory.  They don't generate any output, but define variables and helper
functions required by the other files.

The `config/palette.scss` is a special case.  It's generated automatically
from a palette configuration file.  You can create your own palette to replace
the builtin palette if you want to.  You can read more about it on the
<PaletteLink/> page.

The remaining files are up for grabs.  For example, you can omit the
`forms/all.scss` if you're not interesting in the form styles, or the
`components/all.scss` if you don't want any of the components.  The
`utilities/all.scss` is also optional, although you might find that some of
the components depend on utility classes contained therein.

Or you can create your own versions of those file to pick and choose
which parts you want.
