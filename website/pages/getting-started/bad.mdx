# What's Wrong With It?

<p className="intro wide">
  There are many, many CSS toolkits and UI frameworks already out there
  to choose from. If you're looking for something that's stable, reliable,
  comprehensive and well-supported then this probably isn't for you.

    ## Organic Design

    This is the result of nearly 30 years of evolution in how I use CSS.  It
    started out life as an ad-hoc collection of CSS classes that I copied and
    pasted between projects. In the late 2010s it got integrated into Badger
    UI, a collection of React components implementing some basic UI widgets.
    Now it's been moved out into its own module which concentrates on just
    the CSS without any dependency on React.

    ## Some Assembly Required

    If you have a good working knowledge of modern CSS and SASS then you
    should be able to easily adapt it to your needs.  Nearly everything
    is customisable, either through SASS variables, CSS custom properties,
    or by using the provided scripts to build your own toolkit.

    You don't need to buy in to the whole package.  As well as being
    customisable it's also modular.  With a small amount of effort
    you can configure it to include the bits your want and ignore the rest.
    Or you can browse the source code and borrow the <i>ideas</i> that you
    think are useful.

    Just remember that this is aimed more at people who already know how
    to build web sites and are familiar with CSS. If you're looking
    for a fully-featured, widely used and well supported UI toolkit that
    does everything for you then there are plenty of
    others to choose from.

    If you don't like the sound of that then these probably
    aren't the badgers you're looking for.  You can go about
    your business. Move along.

    ## Opinionated and Selfish Software

    This is based on my personal collection of CSS styles and utility
    classes that I use on a daily basis in my job building web sites for
    clients. It's Open Source and you're welcome to use it but
    be aware that it's something that I built for <em>me</em> to help{' '}
    <em>me</em> get my job done.

    I didn't build it for you (unless you're one of my clients)
    and I don't really have the time or inclination to promote it,
    increase the user base or provide unpaid support for it.  It's
    not my intention for this to be the next great CSS toolkit - there are
    plenty of those already. My goal isn't to change the World, only
    to make it a slightly better place.

    So be warned that it does things the way I like to do them.  You
    may not agree with all my decisions, but that's fine.  They're
    my decisions to make, not yours.  It's free software (in both
    senses: free speech and free beer) and if you don't like it then
    you're entitled to a full refund of the price you paid.

    On the plus-side, the Badger-UI toolkit contains a lot of tried and
    tested techniques for managing web site styles that have been honed
    over nearly 30 years of experience.  It contains the features that I
    can't live without when I'm building a web site.  Of course,
    you may have different ideas about the best way to do it, but this
    is what works for me.  It's supposed to be a reasonable starting
    point not the final destination.
