# Installation

## No Installation Required!

<Snippet

  caption="Unpkg Link"
  expand

  You don't need to install anything to get starting using Badger CSS in a
  website.  Simply add the following tag to the `<head>` section of your
  web page.
</Snippet>


## Adding to a Javascript Project

<Snippet
  file="install/add.sh"
  caption="Installing"
  expand
>
  If you want to configure, modify or adapt Badger CSS then you should add
  `@abw/badger-css` to your Javascript project using your favourite package
  manager.  In most cases you should be able to add it as a development
  dependency using the `-D` option.

## Importing the CSS


<Snippet
  file="install/import.js"
  caption="Importing CSS"
  expand
>
  The precise details on how you import the CSS will vary depending on what
  framework and bundler you're using.  For a React app using Vite or running
  under Next.js, for example, you can add the CSS file to your main
  application script as shown here.

  For other frameworks and/or bundlers you should consult the documentation on
  how to import a CSS file from a module in your `node_modules` directory.
</Snippet>

## Importing the SCSS

<Snippet
  file="install/import.scss"
  caption="Importing SCSS"
  expand
>
  If you're using SASS/SCSS to build your stylesheet then you can import the
  SCSS components.  This gives you the flexibility to configure the default
  options, or to pick and choose which components you want to include.

  Add this line to your main SCSS stylesheet source.
</Snippet>


## Going it Alone

<Snippet
  file="install/repo-sass.sh"
  caption="CSS from SASS"
  expand
>
  If you're not using Javascript but want to play with the SCSS source files
  then you can check out the project repository from Github and run `sass` to
  compile the source files into CSS.
