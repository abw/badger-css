# Installation

## No Installation Required!

You don't need to install anything to get starting using Badger CSS in a
website.  Simply add the following tag to the `<head>` section of your
web page.

<Snippet
  file="install/online-css.html"
  caption="Unpkg Link"
  className="mar-b-8"
  expand
/>

## Adding to a Javascript Project

If you want to configure, modify or adapt Badger CSS then you should add
`@abw/badger-css` to your Javascript project using your favourite package
manager.  In most cases you should be able to add it as a development
dependency using the `-D` option.

<Snippet
  file="install/add.sh"
  caption="Installing"
  className="mar-b-8"
  expand
/>

## Importing the CSS

The precise details on how you import the CSS will vary depending on what
framework and bundler you're using.  For a React app using Vite or running
under Next.js, for example, you can add the CSS file to your main application
script as shown below.

For other frameworks and/or bundlers you should consult the documentation on
how to import a CSS file from a module in your `node_modules` directory.

<Snippet
  file="install/import.js"
  caption="Importing CSS"
  className="mar-b-8"
  expand
/>

## Importing the SCSS

If you're using SASS/SCSS to build your stylesheet then you can import the
SCSS components.  This gives you the flexibility to configure the default
options, or to pick and choose which components you want to include.

Add the following line to your main SCSS stylesheet source.

<Snippet
  file="install/import.scss"
  caption="Importing SCSS"
  className="mar-b-8"
  expand
/>

## Going it Alone

If you're not using Javascript but want to play with the SCSS source files
then you can check out the project repository from Github and run `sass` to
compile the source files into CSS.

<Snippet
  file="install/repo-sass.sh"
  caption="CSS from SASS"
  className="mar-b-8"
  expand
/>
