    <h1>What&apos;s Good About It?</h1>
    <p className="intro wide">
      If you&apos;re wondering what makes Badger CSS better than all the
      other CSS frameworks and UI toolkits out there then the short and
      simple answer is that it isn&apos;t.  It&apos;s just another one to
      add to the pile.
    </p>
    <Split>
      <div>
        <h2>A Solid Foundation</h2>
        <p>
          Badger CSS is a collection of tools and techniques that I&apos;ve built
          up over many years (nearly 30) of building web sites.  It&apos;s what
          works for me and maybe it will work for you too.  But I&apos;m not making
          any promises.
        </p>
        <p>
          It&apos;s supposed to be a starting point, not a destination.  If
          you&apos;re building a web site and you want a reasonable foundation
          to build your styles on then it might be better for you than a more
          fully-featured toolkit that has everything including the kitchen sink.
        </p>

        <h2>Small(ish) and Simple</h2>
        <p>
          The default Badger CSS stylesheet is around 15kb minimised and
          compressed (around 100kb uncompressed).  That includes all 16 color
          ranges which you probably aren&apos;t ever going to need in practice.
          If you define your own palette with a limited set of colors then you
          can reduce the size a fair bit.
        </p>

        <h2>Modern CSS</h2>
        <p>
          It is based on modern CSS techniques and works in all modern browsers.
          In particular it makes heavy use of CSS custom properties that you can
          easily change as required. Behind the scenes it is built using SASS
          (specifically SCSS) which gives you more opportunities for configuring
          and extending it.
        </p>

        <h2>Color Management</h2>
        <p>
          Badger CSS uses a novel approach to defining and selecting{' '}
          <Link to="/colors/ranges" text="color ranges"/>.  The color palette
          was created using <a href="https://abw.github.io/badger-color">Badger
          Color</a> (which itself was created for this specific task) and you can
          use it to create your own custom palettes if necessary.
          The palette data that it generates can be automatically expanded out
          to SASS component files, ready to be used in Badger CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can easily change the hues of the standard palette to match
          your <Link to="/colors/brand" text="brand colors"/>.  It will automatically
          create greyscale color ranges based on your primary brand color.
        </p>
        <p>
          The use of <Link to="/colors/variables" text="CSS custom properties"/>{' '}
          to define color ranges, and CSS class scopes to select them, makes it easy
          to create UI components that work automatically with any color range.
          It also makes it easy to define different color schemes for light and
          dark themes.
        </p>
        <h2>Utility Classes</h2>
        <p>
          Badger CSS comes with a core set of{' '}
          <Link to="/utilities" text="utility classes"/> for ad-hoc styling.
          They are intentionally limited to the kind of things that I find myself
          using all the time.  If you prefer the approach of{' '}
          <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a> that
          provides CSS classes for absolutely everything then you know where to
          find it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I&apos;m not knocking Tailwind, by the way.  CSS utility classes are
          an <em>extremely</em> useful set of tools to have in your toolkit.
          I just think they should be limited in their scope and not a
          replacement for writing &quot;proper&quot; CSS when it&apos;s more
          appropriate to do so.
        </p>

        <h2>Form Styling</h2>
        <p>
          Styling <Link to="/forms" text="forms"/> is not much fun.
          I have wasted many hours, days, even weeks of my life trying to
          get form styling just right and I never want to have to do it again.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you&apos;ve got better things to do than trying to figure out why
          your <code>select</code> component is 1 pixel shorter than your
          text <code>input</code> component then take a look at what Badger CSS
          has to offer.  It provides basic styles for all the standard form
          components and has smoothed over a lot of the problems so you don&apos;t
          have to worry too much about them.  Spend the time you save playing with
          your kids or flying a kite.
        </p>
        <h2>UI Components</h2>
        <p>
          Badger CSS has styling for a limited set of UI components.
          It&apos;s not really supposed to be a complete UI toolkit (because
          the World already has enough of them), but rather to be a foundation
          on which UI components can be built.
        </p>
        <p>
          Experience has taught me that off-the-shelf UI components (even ones
          that I&apos;ve written myself) often need a fair bit of tweaking to
          match the styling for a particular site.  Sometimes it&apos;s easier
          just to write them from scratch as they&apos;re needed.  CSS has come
          a long way since the days when we relied on toolkits like{' '}
          <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> to provide a consistent
          cross-browser experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          That said, it&apos;s useful to have a reasonable starting point for
          some of the common UI components: things like alerts, dialogs,
          dropdown menus, overlays, tables and tooltips.  You can easily
          customise Badger CSS to remove anything you don&apos;t want.
        </p>

        <h2>Light and Dark Themes</h2>
        <p>
          Everything contains styling for both light and dark themes, out of
          the box.
        </p>
        <Theme/>
