# What's Good About It?

<p className="intro wide">
  If you're wondering what makes Badger CSS better than all the
  other CSS frameworks and UI toolkits out there then the short and
  simple answer is that it isn't.  It's just another one to
  add to the pile.

    ## A Solid Foundation

    Badger CSS is a collection of tools and techniques that I've built
    up over many years (nearly 30) of building web sites.  It's what
    works for me and maybe it will work for you too.  But I'm not making
    any promises.

    It's supposed to be a starting point, not a destination.  If
    you're building a web site and you want a reasonable foundation
    to build your styles on then it might be better for you than a more
    fully-featured toolkit that has everything including the kitchen sink.

    ## Small(ish) and Simple

    The default Badger CSS stylesheet is around 15kb minimised and
    compressed (around 100kb uncompressed).  That includes all 16 color
    ranges which you probably aren't ever going to need in practice.
    If you define your own palette with a limited set of colors then you
    can reduce the size a fair bit.

    ## Modern CSS

    It is based on modern CSS techniques and works in all modern browsers.
    In particular it makes heavy use of CSS custom properties that you can
    easily change as required. Behind the scenes it is built using SASS
    (specifically SCSS) which gives you more opportunities for configuring
    and extending it.

    ## Color Management

    Badger CSS uses a novel approach to defining and selecting{' '}
    <RangesLink/>.  The color palette
    was created using <a href="https://badgerpower.com/badger-color/">Badger
    Color</a> (which itself was created for this specific task) and you can
    use it to create your own custom palettes if necessary.
    The palette data that it generates can be automatically expanded out
    to SASS component files, ready to be used in Badger CSS.

    You can easily change the hues of the standard palette to match
    your <BrandLink/>.  It will automatically
    create greyscale color ranges based on your primary brand color.

    The use of <ColVarsLink/> to define color ranges, and CSS class
    scopes to select them, makes it easy to create UI components that
    work automatically with any color range. It also makes it easy to
    define different color schemes for light and dark themes.

    ## Utility Classes

    Badger CSS comes with a core set of <UtilitiesLink/> for ad-hoc styling.
    They are intentionally limited to the kind of things that I find myself
    using all the time.  If you prefer the approach of{' '}
    <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a> that
    provides CSS classes for absolutely everything then you know where to
    find it.

    I'm not knocking Tailwind, by the way.  CSS utility classes are
    an <em>extremely</em> useful set of tools to have in your toolkit.
    I just think they should be limited in their scope and not a
    replacement for writing &quot;proper&quot; CSS when it's more
    appropriate to do so.

    ## Form Styling

    Styling <FormsLink/> is not much fun. I have wasted many hours, days,
    even weeks of my life trying to get form styling just right and I
    never want to have to do it again.

    If you've got better things to do than trying to figure out why
    your <code>select</code> component is 1 pixel shorter than your
    text <code>input</code> component then take a look at what Badger CSS
    has to offer.  It provides basic styles for all the standard form
    components and has smoothed over a lot of the problems so you don't
    have to worry too much about them.  Spend the time you save playing with
    your kids or flying a kite.

    ## UI Components

    Badger CSS has styling for a limited set of UI components.
    It's not really supposed to be a complete UI toolkit (because
    the World already has enough of them), but rather to be a foundation
    on which UI components can be built.

    Experience has taught me that off-the-shelf UI components (even ones
    that I've written myself) often need a fair bit of tweaking to
    match the styling for a particular site.  Sometimes it's easier
    just to write them from scratch as they're needed.  CSS has come
    a long way since the days when we relied on toolkits like{' '}
    <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> to provide a consistent
    cross-browser experience.

    That said, it's useful to have a reasonable starting point for
    some of the common UI components: things like alerts, dialogs,
    dropdown menus, overlays, tables and tooltips.  You can easily
    customise Badger CSS to remove anything you don't want.

    ## Light and Dark Themes

    Everything contains styling for both light and dark themes, out of
    the box.
