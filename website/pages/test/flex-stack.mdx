# Flexbox Stacking

I `optimised` the flex stacking rules and broke the case where the child
elements have an explicit width, e.g. when using `split-N` classes.  These
should stack when the screen width is less than 960px.  With my optimisation
in place they didn't but they should now.

<Example
  html={Stack}
  caption="Even Splits"
/>
