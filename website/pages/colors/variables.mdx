# Color Variables

## SASS Color Variables

Each stop in a color range has a SASS variable defined, e.g.
`$red-0`, `$red-5`, `$red-10` and so on.  You can use these in your SASS
components as necessary.

## CSS Custom Properties

Each of the colour stops also has a corresponding CSS custom property
(a.k.a. CSS variable) defined, e.g. `--red-0`, `--red-5`, `--red-10` and so
on.  You can use these in your CSS files, e.g. as `color: var(--red-10)`.

Each of your brand colors will also have CSS custom properties defined.
If you're using the default `brand` name then they will be `--brand-0`,
`--brand-5`, `--brand-10` and so on.

If you have defined a different set of names via `$brand-colors` then they
will have corresponding names.  For example, if you defined the names in
your `$brand-colors` to be `primary`, `secondary` and `tertiary` then the
custom properties will be `--primary-0`, `--secondary-0`, `--tertiary-0`,
and so on.

## Color Switching

### Generic Variables

<Split>
  CSS custom properties are defined for a generic color, appropriately
  named `color`.  By default they are mapped to grey.

  <div>
    <ScopeVars
      scope='grey'
      to='grey'
    />
  </div>
</Split>

### Color Range Mapping

<Split>
  CSS scopes will be generated for each color range which map the generic
  colors to the colors from that range.  For example, the{' '}
  `.red` class selector scope will map the colors as shown
  here.

  <div>
    <h3 className="font-mono mar-t-none mar-b-2">.red {'{'} ... {'}'}</h3>
    <ScopeVars
      scope='red'
      to='red'
      abbreviate={true}
    />
  </div>
</Split>

### Brand Color Mapping

<Split>
  <div>
    Scopes will also be generated for your brand colors, either using the
    default `brand` name or the custom names you have defined using
    `$brand-colors`.

    For example, in the `.brand` scope the colors will be
    mapped as follows.
  </div>
  <div>
    <h3 className="font-mono mar-b-2 mar-t-none">.brand {'{'} ... {'}'}</h3>
    <ScopeVars
      scope='brand'
      to='brand'
      abbreviate={true}
    />
  </div>
</Split>

The benefit of this approach is that it allows you to define UI components
using the generic colors `--color-N`.  By default they will appear in grey,
but adding a CSS class matching the color name will switch in the appropriate
color range.

## CSS Scope Aliases

A number of additional CSS scopes are defined for some of the colors.
For example, the CSS scope created for the `red` color range is actually
`.red, .error, .invalid`.  This allows you to add the `red`, `error` or
`invalid` CSS class to an element to have the red color range selected.

This is used by <FormsLink/> and <AlertsLink/>, for example, to provide
semantic names for the colors.
