# Custom Palette

The pre-defined color palette is a good starting point for building
a web site.  There's a certain amount of flexibility built in to
the SASS source files: you can adjust the hues of the different color
ranges, define your own brand color or colors, and specify which of the
color ranges you want to include (and implicitly, which ones you
don't want).

When you need a bit more flexibility you can head over to the
<a href="https://badgerpower.com/badger-color/">Badger Color</a> web app
and either customise one of the standard palettes or design your own
palette from scratch.

You can then download the palette data as a JSON file and use the
script provided to generate the SCSS configuration files for your
palette, ready to integrate into Badger CSS.  At any point you can
upload the palette back into Badger Color, make some adjustments,
download it again and repeat the process.

You'll need to have `@abw/badger-css` installed as a developer dependency
for your project for these next steps to work. See the <InstallLink/> page
for details (TL;DR: `npm add -D @abw/badger-css` or the equivalent with
`yarn` or `pnpm`).

## Palette Configuration File

<Snippet
  file="palette/export-my-palette.yaml"
  caption="config/export-my-palette.yaml"
  expand
>
  For these examples, we'll assume that you've download your custom palette
  file and saved it in a `config` directory under your project root as
  `my-palette.json`.  It doesn't have to be in the `config` directory - you
  can put it anywhere you like in your project.

  You then need to create a configuration file like the one shown here.  It
  can be a YAML file or JSON file, you can call it anything you like (as long
  as it has a `.yaml` or `.json` file extension), and you can put it anywhere
  you like in your project. Here we'll assume it's called `export-my-palette.yaml`
  and is also located in the `config` directory under the project root.

  You should define `palette` to be the path to your palette data file
  (relative to the project root), and `output` to be a path to the directory
  where you want the SCSS files to be written (also relative to the project
  root).

  You can also define your brand color as `brandColor`. There are other
  configuration options you can specify but we'll keep it simple for now.

## Adding a `package.json` Script

<Snippet
  file="palette/package.json"
  caption="package.json"
  expand
>
  Then add a line to the `scripts` section of your `package.json` file like
  this.

  The `-c` (or `--config` if you prefer verbosity) option tells it where your
  config file is located.  The `-v` (or `--verbose`) option enables messages
  to tell you what it's doing.  You can leave this off if you prefer.
</Snippet>

## Export the Palette as SCSS

<Snippet
  file="palette/run-script"
  caption="Exporting the palette"
  language='bash'
  expand
>
  You can then `run palette` from the command line using `npm`, `yarn` or
  `pnpm`, depending on which package manager you're using.

  If you've got the verbose mode enabled, you should see a message reporting
  each color range being written to a file in `style/color/range/XXX`, and
  the main palette index file being written to `style/color/palette.scss`.
</Snippet>

## Defining a Custom `badger.scss` File

<Snippet
  file="palette/badger.scss"
  caption="Custom badger.scss"
  expand
>
  Now you need to define your own version of the main `badger.scss` which
  loads your palette instead of the default one.

  In this example we'll assume that it's saved as `badger.scss` in the
  `styles` directory, alongside the newly created `color` directory that
  has been exported from the palette.

  This is also a good place to set any SASS variables that change
  the defaults for Badger CSS.  They should go at the top of this
  file.
</Snippet>

## Replace the Standard `badger.scss` File

<Snippet
  file="palette/inc-badger.scss"
  caption="Including your badger.scss"
  expand
>
  Now you just need to include the new file `badger.scss`{' '}
  into your website or main stylesheet.  If you were previously loading
  the default `badger.scss` then should change the path to
  point to your new local `badger.scss` file.
