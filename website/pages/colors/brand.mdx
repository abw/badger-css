# Brand Colours

The palette is designed to be adjustable so that you can match it to
your brand colors.

## Brand Hue and Color
<Source
  code={brand}
  caption="Brand Color"
  language='scss'

  You should pick a color that is closest to your brand color and adjust
  the hue to match it if necessary.  Then define that as the `$brand-hue`
  and set the `$brand-color` by name.

## Multiple Brand Colors

  If you have multiple brand colors you can set them using the `$brand-colors`
  variable.  You can call them whatever you like (we're using `primary`,
  `secondary` and `tertiary` in this example). You should define one to be
  the primary `$brand-color` and set the `$brand-hue`.

## Greyscale Colors

  An important side-effect of setting `$brand-hue` is that it will set the
  hue of the greyscale color ranges to match it.

  If you want to use different hues for the greyscale color ranges then you
  can do that using the `$grey-hue`, `$grey20-hue` and `$grey40-hue` variables.

## Culling the Palette

  The chances are that you aren't going to need all of the colors
  defined in the standard palette.  You can reduce the size of the
  generated CSS file by excluding any that you don't need.

  Set the `$color-names` variable to list those that you want to keep.  Note
  that `red`, `orange`,{' '}
  `green`, `blue` and `grey` are used
  by various components, including <FormsLink/> and{' '}
  <AlertsLink/> so you'll probably
  want to keep those.
