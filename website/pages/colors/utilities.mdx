# Color Utilities

## Color Classes

Each of the color ranges defined in your palette has a corresponding class.
For example, the `red` class can be used to select the red color range.  Some
of the colors also have semantic aliases, e.g. `error` and `invalid` are
aliases for `red`.

Selecting a color range doesn't have much of a visible effect by itself.
The important things is that it maps the `--color-N` CSS custom properties to
the equivalent stops from the selected color range.  For example, in the scope
of the `red` CSS class, the `--color-0` property is mapped to `--red-0`,
`--color-5` is mapped to `--red-5`, `--color-10` to `--red-10` and so on up to 100.

<ColorRanges/>

## Foreground, Background and Border Colors

The `fgc-N`, `bgc-N`, `hdc-N` and `bdc-N` classes can be used to select a stop
from the color range for the foreground color, background color, heading color
and border color, respectively.

For example, the `bgc-80` CSS class will set the background color to whatever
color is mapped to `--color-80`.  In the scope of the `red` CSS class, that
will be `--red-80`.

  <ClassMap
    classes={[
      ['fgc-N', '--color',            <><b>f</b>ore<b>g</b>round <b>c</b>olor stop <code>N</code></>],
      ['bgc-N', '--background-color', <><b>b</b>ack<b>g</b>round <b>c</b>olor stop <code>N</code></>],
      ['hdc-N', '--heading-color',    <><b>h</b>ea<b>d</b>ing <b>c</b>olor stop <code>N</code></>],
      ['bdc-N', '--border-color',     <><b>b</b>or<b>d</b>er <b>c</b>olor stop <code>N</code></>]
    ]}
  />
  <div>
    <Note>
      The `bdc-N` classes are designed to be used in conjunction with the
      `border` class and other classes for setting <BorderLink/> properties.
      A `bdc-N` class will set the color border, but you won't see any effect
      unless you also add the `border` class.

## Dark Theme

The `fgd-N`, `bgd-N`, `hdd-N` and `bdd-N` classes are equivalents of the above
for when a dark theme is selected.  You can set foreground, background, heading
and border colors for both light and dark themes and they will be switched
in automatically.

<Split>
  <ClassMap
    classes={[
      ['fgd-N', '--color',            <><b>f</b>ore<b>g</b>round <b>d</b>ark theme color stop <code>N</code></>],
      ['bgd-N', '--background-color', <><b>b</b>ack<b>g</b>round <b>d</b>ark theme color stop <code>N</code></>],
      ['hdd-N', '--heading-color',    <><b>h</b>ea<b>d</b>ing <b>d</b>ark theme color stop <code>N</code></>],
      ['bdd-N', '--border-color',     <><b>b</b>or<b>d</b>er <b>d</b>ark theme color stop <code>N</code></>]
    ]}
  />
  <Note>
    The same rule applies for `bdd-N` as it does for `bdc-N` - it selects the
    border color but you still need to add the `border` class to make the
    border visible.

## Color Inheritance

CSS custom properties are inherited by child elements.  This means you can
select a color range on an element and all children will inherit that color
range.

## Easy Component Coloring

This effect is used by various badger-css components. They use the generic
`--color-N` properties to define colors and can then be rendered using any
color range.

  file="color/components.html"

### Creating Your Own Colored Components

You can employ this in your own components by using the `--color-N` CSS custom
properties to define your component colours.

This is particularly useful when implementing components for both light and
dark themes.  You only need to specify which `--color-N` stops you want to use
in each case.  You don't need to write separate CSS rules for each of the
colors you might want to use.

## Inverse Colors

The `inverse` CSS class can be added as a shortcut to define an inverse color
block.
