# Checkboxes

## Checkbox Class

The usual approach to creating a checkbox is to define a `label` that contains
an `input` with a `type="label"` attribute.  This has the benefit that
clicking on the label will toggle the checkbox input.

Badger-CSS identifies labels that include a checkbox input using the
`:has()` CSS selector. All the major browsers currently support it, although
Firefox was a bit late to the party, only adding support in v121 released on
19th December 2023.

As a work-around to support older versions of Firefox, you can add the
`checkbox` class to the `label`.

<Snippet
  file="checkbox/checkboxes.html"
  caption="Checkboxes"
  output
/>

## Inline Checkboxes

Checkboxes are full-width by default. Add the `inline` class to give it a
fluid width.

<Snippet
  file="checkbox/inline.html"
  caption="Inline Checkboxes"
  output
/>

## Checkbox Borders

Add the `border` class for borders.  You may need to manually add margins
using the <SpacingLink text="margin"/> utility classes, or contain multiple
checkboxes using the <FlexLink/> or <GridLink/> container classes and set the
gap between elements.

<Snippet
  file="checkbox/border.html"
  caption="Border Checkboxes"
  output
/>

## Checkbox Switches

Set the `role` to `switch` to display the checkbox as a switch.  Add the
`round` class for a fully rounded switch or `square` for square corners.

The background color for enabled switches will be based on your brand color.
There are a number of CSS properties you can set to customise the style.

<Snippet
  file="checkbox/switch.html"
  caption="Checkbox Switch"
  output
/>

## Custom Checkboxes

<Snippet
  file="checkbox/custom.html"
  caption="Custom Checkboxes"
