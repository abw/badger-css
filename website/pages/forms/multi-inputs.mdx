# Multiple Input


Sometimes you need to create a form component that looks like a single input
but is comprised of multiple inputs or other elements.


In this case you can wrap them up in a container with the `inputs` class.
See the <Link to="/forms/prefix-suffix" text="Prefix and Suffix"/> page for
details on adding the prefix icon.

## Credit Card Number

In this example we create an input for a credit card number. This demo doesn't
have any interactive functionality and leaves a lot to be desired in terms of
user experience.  For example, you can enter more than 4 numbers in each
section, the focus doesn't automatically switch from one block to the next,
and so on. But this is only supposed to be a demonstration of the styling, not
the functionality.

Making it work properly is left as an exercise for the reader.

<Example
  html={CCard}
  language="html"
  caption="Credit Card"
/>

## Date

This is also a less-than-perfect implementation in terms of functionality, but
it demonstrates the basic principle of combining inputs.

<Example
  html={Date}
  language="html"
  caption="Date"
/>
