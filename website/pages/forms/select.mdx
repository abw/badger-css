# Select Input

Select inputs are the bane of web developers and designers everywhere. There
are notoriously difficult to style.  They don't want to align with other
elements.  Their size is often wrong.  And just when you think you've finally
cracked it, you look at it on another browser and see that it's all on the wonk.

I have wasted far too many hours of my life starting at forms like this one
trying to get everything the same size and aligned properly.

<Snippet
  file="select/alignment.html"
  caption="Select Alignment"
  output

The least bad solution is to set `appearance: none` to remove the
browser-specific rendering quirks.  The problem then is that you also lose
drop down arrow indicating that it's a select input.  So we have to put that
back in using an SVG background image. But you don't need to worry about
that - I did so you don't have to.

<Snippet
  file="select/select.html"
  caption="Select Input"
  output

## Inline Select Input

Select inputs are full-width by default.  Add the `inline` class to make them
only as wide as necessary.

<Snippet
  file="select/inline.html"
  caption="Inline Select"
  output
/>

## Grid and Flex Layout

You can also use the <GridLink/> and <FlexLink/> classes to control layout.

<Snippet
  file="select/grid-flex.html"
  caption="Grid/Flex"
  output
/>

## Custom Icon

You can define your own drop down arrow icon using the `--arrow-down`
property.  It's a little bit tricky because you have to URI encode the SVG
and define it as shown in this Snippet.  If you've got an SVG icon with a
simple path and your icon is 16px square then you can copy the definition
from this Snippet and insert your path data into the `path d='...'` part.

Note that you can't use `currentColor` to set the stroke or fill color.  You
can define separate `--arrow-down` properties for your light and dark themes,
or you can use a neutral color like `#888` which works well in both cases.

<Snippet
  file="select/custom.html"
  caption="Custom Icon"
  output
/>

## Placeholder

Another annoying thing about select inputs is that they don't support the
`placeholder` attribute.  You can work around the problem by adding the
`required` attribute to the `select` input and the `hidden`, `disabled` and
`selected` attributes to the first option which contains your placeholder text.

<Snippet
  file="select/placeholder.html"
  caption="Select Placeholder"
  output
/>

## Option Groups

You can group options using the `optgroup` element.

<Snippet
  file="select/optgroup.html"
  caption="Option Groups"
  output
/>
