# Form Fields

Form fields are usually comprised of more than just an input. A label is
usually present and sometimes an additional help message too.

## Field Class

Create a container with the `field` class. You can then add a `label` for the
field. If you want to display additional help for the input then give it the
`help` class.

<Snippet
  file="field/field.html"
  caption="Form Field"
  output
/>

## Field Width

Fields are wide by default, but you can add the `inline` class to the input
element or containing label in the case of checkboxes and radio buttons.

<Snippet
  file="field/text.html"
  caption="Text Field"
  output
/>
<Snippet
  file="field/checkbox.html"
  caption="Checkbox Field"
  output
/>
<Snippet
  file="field/radio.html"
  caption="Radio Button Field"
  output
/>

## Invalid Field

Add the `invalid` class to the `field` to indicate fields that are invalid.

<Snippet
  file="field/invalid.html"
  caption="Invalid Field"
  output
/>

## Valid Field

Add the `valid` class to the `field` to indicate fields that have passed validation.

<Snippet
  file="field/valid.html"
  caption="Valid Field"
  output
/>

## Required Field

Add the `required` class to the `field` if you want an additional tag added to the label.

<Snippet
  file="field/required.html"
  caption="Required Field"
  output
/>

You can use the `--required-text` CSS variable to change the text displayed.

<Snippet
  file="field/required-custom.html"
  caption="Custom Required Field"
  output
/>

## Optional Field

Add the `optional` class to the `field` if you want an additional tag added
to the label.

<Snippet
  file="field/optional.html"
  caption="Optional Field"
  output
/>

You can use the `--optional-text` CSS variable to change the text displayed.

<Snippet
  file="field/optional-custom.html"
  caption="Custom Optional Field"
  output
/>

<Snippet
  file="sass/field-required-text.scss"
  caption="Required Text"
  expand
>
  You can also change the text displayed for either the required and/or
  optional labels on a global level by setting the `$field-required-text`
  and `$field-optional-text` SASS variables. Be warned that you need to
  quote the values twice, so that the value defined includes a set of quotes,
  as shown here.
</Snippet>

## Label Spacing

The `mar-t-label` and `pad-t-label` classes will add a margin or padding to
the top of an element that matches the height of a field label.  This is
useful if you want to vertically align inputs or other elements where some
fields have label and others don't.

<Snippet
  file="field/label-space.html"
  caption="Label Spacing"
  output
/>

## Help Prefix

The validation messages on valid and invalid fields have a prefix added by
default - a check mark for valid fields and a cross for invalid ones. If you
don't like this then you can always customise the CSS (by adding a rule for
`.field` that sets `--help-prefix: ""` and `--help-prefix-margin: 0`).
Or you can add a `data-badger-help-prefix="none"` attribute to a container
element.

<Snippet
  file="field/no-help-prefix.html"
  caption="Help Prefix"
  output
/>
