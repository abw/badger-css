# Forms

<blockquote className="intro">
  There is something about styling forms, that's so not fun.
  It's like *"How much less fun could this be?"* and the answer
  is *"None, none... less fun."*

## None Less Fun

Anyone reading this who is old enough to have served in the browser wars will
no doubt be rolling their eyes at this point, thinking that kids these days
don't know how lucky they are.

It's certainly true that things are *much* better than they used to be.  But
despite all the advances in CSS support and cross-browser compatibility, the
default styling for HTML forms still looks like 1995 called and asked for its
website back.

Badger CSS includes form styling presets, supporting both light and dark
themes out of the box. It uses native form components for accessibility and
mobile friendliness.  Everything is configurable if you want to change things,
but you don't have to.

Here's the same form rendered twice.  Once with the default HTML styling and
again with the default Badger CSS styles.  In case you're wondering, there's
no Javascript in any of these forms.  It's all just vanilla HTML and CSS.

## Adaptive Sizes

<Split>
  All form components are sized using ems and will adapt to whatever
  the current text size is.  If you want a small form, for example, then
  you just need to add a `small` class to the form or one of
  its parent containers.

  <Note title="Try it out" className="mar-t-4">
    Try selecting different sizes from the options below and see how
    the form inputs scale.
  </Note>
</Split>

## Accessibility and Focus

If you've played with any of the forms above you may have noticed
the prominent ring around inputs when focussed.  This is important for
accessibility to clearly indicate which field is selected.

For buttons,
checkboxes and radio buttons we use the <code>:focus-visible</code> selector
instead of <code>:focus</code>.  This will add the focus ring when the
element is navigated to using the keyboard (e.g. by pressing the TAB key)
but not when the element is directly clicked on.  After all, if you've
just clicked on an element then it's usually safe to assume you
know that it has the focus.

By default the focus ring is displayed outside the input or button.
You can add the <code>data-badger-focus=&quot;inset&quot;</code> attribute
to a container element to switch the focus ring to be inset for any
inputs or buttons contained within it.

<Snippet
  file="form/inset-outset.html"
  language="html"
  output
/>

If for some reason you really, really need to disabled it because
you're indicating the focus some other way then you can add the{' '}
<code>no-focus</code> class to the inputs.

<Snippet
  file="form/no-focus.html"
  language="html"
  output
/>

## Themes and Surfaces

Styling forms is made that much harder these days by the need to support
both light and dark themes.  On top of that we might want to have forms
included on different surfaces with varying levels of background intensity.
Thanks to the magic of CSS custom properties we can tweak the colors
used to render forms depending on the background color of the container.
In these examples below it may not be immediately obvious that the
colors are slightly different but they are.  They're different
so that they look more-or-less the same, while providing adequate
contrast.
