# Buttons

For the sake of accessibility, buttons should usually be rendered using the
`button` element.  I mean, that's what it's there for, right?  For those cases
when you really need to make a link or something else look like a button you
can add the `button` class.

<div className="small flex gap-2">
  <button>button element</button>
  <a href="/" className="button">button class</a>
</div>

The default button color is grey. Any one of the color classes (e.g. `red`,
`green`, etc) can be added to get different colors.

Button color stops automatically adapt between light and dark modes.

## Default Style

The default button style is solid.

<Example
  html={Default}
  language="html"
  caption="Buttons"
/>

## Bright Colors

Add the `bright` CSS class to make the buttons brighter.

<Example
  html={Bright}
  language="html"
  caption="Bright Buttons"
/>

## Dark Colors

Add the `dark` CSS class to make the buttons darker.

<Example
  html={Dark}
  language="html"
  caption="Dark Buttons"
/>

## Outline Style

Add the `outline` class for outline buttons.

<Example
  html={Outline}
  caption="Outline Buttons"
/>

## Bare Naked Buttons

Add the `bare` class for remove the background and border completely.

<Example
  html={Bare}
  caption="Bare Buttons"
/>

## Shaded Style

Add the `shaded` class for subtly shaded buttons.  It's only a matter of time
until flat design is out and shaded is back in. Be ahead of the curve!

<Example
  html={Shaded}
  caption="Shaded Buttons"
/>

## Button Class

Add the `button` class to any non-button element to give it the button
styling.  You can also add the `outline`, `shaded` and other variant classes.

<Example
  html={Class}
  caption=".button class"
/>

## Disabled Buttons

Add the `disabled` attribute or `disabled` CSS
class to disable a button.

<Example
  html={Disabled}
  language="html"
  caption="Disabled Buttons"
/>

## Button Icons

You can add SVG <IconsLink/> to buttons. You can set the margins for icons
manually using the `mar-N` classes described on the <SpacingLink/> page.
The `on-left` and `on-right` classes are provided as shortcuts and are
equivalent to `mar-r-2` and `mar-l-2`, respectively.

<Example
  html={Icons}
  caption="Button icons"
/>

## Button Padding

The default padding for buttons is larger in the horizontal direction
(4 units = 1em) than it is in the vertical direction (1 unit = 0.25em).
This isn't as unbalanced as it initially seems when you factor in the
line-height (1.5), which effectively results in  the vertical padding being
equivalent to 2 units (0.5em).

If you have a button that only contains an icon then it can look a bit
strange, as shown in the first button here.  Adding the `pad-h-2` class to
the button will reduce the horizontal padding to 2 units (0.5em) which will
even things out, as shown in the second button.  Or you can add the `icon`
class to the button which will have the same effect and doesn't require
you to remember how many units of padding you need to set.

<Example
  html={Padding}
  caption="Button padding"
/>

## Button Sets

Button sets can be created by adding a container with the `buttons` class.

<Example
  html={Buttons}
  caption="Button Sets"
/>
