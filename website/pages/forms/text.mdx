# Text Input


Text inputs are perhaps the most common kind of input.

<Example
  html={Text}
  language="html"
  caption="Text Input"
/>

## Inline Text Input

Inputs are full-width by default. Add the `inline` class to give it a fluid
width.

<Example
  html={Inline}
  language="html"
  caption="Inline Text Input"
/>

## Grid and Flex Layout

You can also use the <GridLink/> and <FlexLink/> classes to control layout.

<Example
  html={GridFlex}
  language="html"
  caption="Grid and Flex"
/>

## Other Input Types

You can set the `type` to one of the other text-based input types (e.g.
`password`, `number`, `telephone`, `date`, `time`, etc). There's also some
styling provided for the `color` type although it's notoriously hard to style
and the appearance can vary on different browsers, devices and operating
systems.

<Example
  html={Types}
  language="html"
  caption="Other Input Types"
/>

## Disabled Text Input

Add the `disabled` attribute to disable the input or the `disabled` CSS class.

<Example
  html={Disabled}
  language="html"
  caption="Disabled Text Input"
/>
