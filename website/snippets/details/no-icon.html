    It's like you become one with the guys in the band. I mean there's,
    there's no division, you just, the music just unites people, with
    the players.

    Visionaries

  <p>
    We're very lucky in the sense that we've got two visionaries in the band.
    David and Nigel are both like, uh, like poets, you know, like Shelley or
    Byron, or people like that.

  <p>
    The two totally distinct types of visionaries,
    it's like fire and ice, basically, you see and I feel my role in the band,
    is to be kind of in the middle of that, kind of like lukewarm water, in a
    sense.
