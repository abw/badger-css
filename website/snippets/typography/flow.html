    Before I met Jeanine, my life was cosmically in shambles, it was, ah, I was
    using bits and pieces of whatever Eastern philosophies happened to drift
    through my transom and she sort of sorted it out for me, straightened it out
    for me, gave me a path, you know, a path to follow.

    This one... this 'course is a custom three-pickup 'Paul. This is my radio...
    unit... So I strap this...this piece on, you know, right down in here when
    I'm on stage and... It's a wireless. Wireless, exactly. And... uh I can play
    without all the mucky-muck. You can run anywhere on stage with that. Exactly.

    We're very lucky in the sense that we've got two visionaries in the David and
    Nigel are both like, uh, like poets, you know, like Shelley or Byron, or
    people like that. The two totally distinct types of visionaries, it's like
    fire and ice, basically, you see and I feel my role in the band, is to be
    kind of in the middle of that, kind of like lukewarm water, in a sense.

    Ohh, quite exiting, quite exiting this computer magic, wheeeee... How many uh

    It's my job to do what I'm asked to do by the creative element of this band.
    And that's what I did. C'mon... The audience were laughing. So it became a
    comedy number. Yes it did! Yes it fucking well did, and it was not pleasant
    to be part of the comedy on stage. Backstage, perhaps, it was very amusing.

  <p>
    I believe virtually everything I read, and I think that is what makes me more
    of a selective human, than someone who doesn't believe anything.
