    This is the top of the heap right here. There's no question about it. Look at
    the, look at the flame on that one... I mean it's just... it's quite
    unbelievable. This one is just ah... is perfect... 1959... ah... you know, it
    just, you can uh...listen! Just listen for a minute... The sustain...listen
    to it... I'm not hearing anything. You would, though, if it were playing,
    because it really... it's famous for its sustain... I mean, you could, just
    hold it... Aaaaaaaaaaaaaa... You could go and have a bite and... aaaaaaaaa...
    you'd still be hearin' that one.

    This one... this 'course is a custom three-pickup 'Paul. This is my radio...
    unit... So I strap this...this piece on, you know, right down in here when
    I'm on stage and... It's a wireless. Wireless, exactly. And... uh I can play
    without all the mucky-muck. You can run anywhere on stage with that. Exactly.

    Now this is special, too, it's a... look... see... still got the uh... the
    ol' tagger on it... see... never even played it... see... Don't touch it!
    Don't touch it! No one...no one...no! Don't touch it. Well don't point, even.
    No. It can't be played...never... I mean I... Can I look at it? No. No
    you've seen enough of that one.
