    If you were to have something written
    as your epitaph... "Here lies David
    St. Hubbins... and why not?" You feel
    that sums up your... your life? No,
    it's the first thing I could think of.
    It doesn't sum up anything, really.

    I'm a real fish nut. I really like fish...
    What kind of fish? Well, in the United
    States, you have cod... I like cod. And
    I love tuna... those little cans you've
    got here... tuna fish... no bones!

    If you could not play rock'n roll, what
    would you do? Well, I suppose I could,
    uh, work in a shop of some kind or...
    or do uh... freelance... selling of some
    sort of...uh... product, you know... A
    salesman, like, maybe in a haberdasher,
    or maybe like a... uh a chapeau shop, or
    something... you know, like: "Would you...
    what size do you wear, sir?" and then you
    answer me. Uh... seven and a quarter.
    "I think we have that...", you see,
    something like that I could do. "No! We're
    all out, do you wear black?", see, that
    sort of thing, I think I could probably
    muster up. Yeah, do you think you'd be
    happy doing that? Well, I don't know,
    wh-wh-what are the hours?
