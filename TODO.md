# TODO

## Utilities

* should radius use em not rem?
* --border-radius not working with border?
* Change theme selector to data-theme="..."
* change flexbox/grid start and end to be top and bottom

## Forms

* change form focus box-shadow to outline? (does that handle corner radius?)

* Change button selector to role="button"

* Prefix/Suffix in dark mode isn't quite right - too little contrast in
prefix/suffix and wrong background color when bare.
