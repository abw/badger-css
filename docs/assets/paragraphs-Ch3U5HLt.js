  Ian, can I have a word with you for a minute?
</p>
<p>
  Uh, a couple of
  problems with the... arrangements backstage... Well, uh.. Well, no,
  there's some problems here, I don't even know where to start, alright?
</p>
<p>
  This, uh.. No, no, no, no this... look, look, look, there's a little
  problem with the... look this, this miniature bread. It's like...
  I've been working with this now for about half an hour. I can't
  figure out... Let's say I want a bite, right, you've got this...
</p>
<p>
  You'd like bigger bread?
</p>
<p>
  Exactly! I don't understand how...
</p>
<p>
  You could fold this though...
</p>
<p>
  Well, no then it's half the size.
</p>
<p>
  Not the bread, you could fold the meat.
</p>
<p>
  Yeah, but then it, then it breaks up, breaks apart like this.
</p>
<p>
  No, no, no, you put it on the bread like this, you see...
</p>
<p>
  But then, if you keep folding it, it keeps breaking... And then you...
  everything has to be folded, and then it's this, and I don't want this
  I want large bread so that I can put this... so then it's like this,
  this does not work because then... it's all... Would you be seen holding
  this?
