    I do not, for one, think that the problem was that the
    band was down. I think that the problem may have been...
    that there was a Stonehenge monument on the stage that
    was in danger of being crushed by a dwarf. Alright? That
    tended to understate the hugeness of the object.

    May I make a suggestion? May I make a suggestion?
    I've got one other suggestion.
  </p>
  <p>
    Well let's hear yours. Let's hear your suggestion.
  </p>
  <p>
    Stonehenge! It's the best production value we've
    ever had on stage.
  </p>
  <p>
    But we haven't got the equipment. We haven't got the
    equipment, we haven't got Stonehenge, we haven't...
  </p>
  <p>
    Not yet we don't. Let's start... Musically, musically
    we all know it. Musically we all know it. Right? No
    problems musically. We go right on stage. And it's quite
    simple. This is you know... Ian can take care of this...
  </p>
  <p>
    I know what the Stonehenge monument looks like.
    We don't have that piece of scenery anymore.
  </p>
  <p>
    I know, so we build a new one. And this is it, look!
