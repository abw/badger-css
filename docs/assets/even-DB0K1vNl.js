    I do not, for one, think that the problem was that
    the band was down. I think that the problem may
    have been... that there was a Stonehenge monument
    on the stage that was in danger of being crushed
    by a dwarf. Alright? That tended to understate the
    hugeness of the object.

    Making a big thing out of it would've been a good idea.
